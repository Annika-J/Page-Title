                Acomplishments
            </div>
            About me: I have used inspiration from my personal life to influence my projects, like how gravity falls is based off of the summers me and my sister spent in Oregon with our great aunt. I've worked with my friends to raise more than $250,000 for a few charities. I value my friends and family above everything! (Except maybe puzzles and goofs)

Accomplishments: I have a successful career in making cartoons and voice acting! Some of the shows I've landed my voice too have been; My own show (Gravity falls), fish hooks, the owl house, and many more! Not to mention that I've won quite few awards in my time! From about three annie awards to even a peabody award. I've also been on letterman cause of my bird calling! (uh, don't ask)
